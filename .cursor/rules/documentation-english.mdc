All documentation files, including but not limited to:
- README files
- Markdown documentation files (*.md, *.mdx)
- Code comments that serve as documentation
- Architecture and specification documents
- API documentation
- User guides and tutorials
- Agent documentation (AGENTS.md, SPECS.md, etc.)
- Changelogs and license files

Must be written exclusively in English. This applies to:
- Human-facing documentation
- Agent-facing documentation (rules, specifications, etc.)
- Inline documentation comments
- Documentation strings

Exceptions: Code comments that are not documentation (e.g., temporary debug comments, TODO comments in non-English for internal use) may use other languages, but all formal documentation must be in English.

The file `AGENTS.md` in the project root is the definitive source of truth for all project rules, conventions, architecture, and implementation guidelines. When there are conflicts between rules or ambiguity, refer to `AGENTS.md` as the authoritative reference.

**IMPORTANT**: Never, under any circumstances, create a rule in `.cursor`. All project rules must be defined in `AGENTS.md` only.

# Backlog

This folder contains task specifications referenced by the roadmap and idea documents.

## Notes

- Some backlog items are retained as **historical stubs** to preserve links from `ideas/` even after implementation is complete.
- If you add new tasks, prefer following the task template and workflow described in `AGENTS.md`.
